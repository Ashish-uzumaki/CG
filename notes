Intel and AMD, differentiate themselves from traditional CPU designs by prioritizing high-throughput processing of
many parallel operations over the low-latency execution of a single task.

The key to high performance lies in strategies that hardware components and their corresponding software interfaces use
to keep GPU processing resources busy. GPU designs go to great lengths to obtain high efficiency, conveniently reducing
the difficulty programmers face when programming graphics applications. As a result, GPUs deliver high performance and
expose an expressive but simple programming interface. This interface remains largely devoid of explicit parallelism or
asynchronous execution and has proven to be portable across vendor implementations and generations of GPU designs.
